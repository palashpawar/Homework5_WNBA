In R Studio, I created a graph of the distribution of the three-point shooting percentage made by each players. Then reported and interpreted the appropriate statistics like mean and median.
Then I created a graph that shows the relationship between the minutes played by each player and their three-point shooting percentage. I chose one particular player, Ariel Atkins, and highlighted her point on the graph and labeled it with her name.

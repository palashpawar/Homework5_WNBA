There are a total of 183 WNBA players in the roster for 2024.

```

Above is a table with descriptive statistics regarding the Three-point Shooting Percentage. The mean percentage is around 30%, which means that the average player made 1 out of every 3 shots from the three-point line.

# Question 3

```{r, echo=FALSE}

wnba_clean <- wnba |>
  filter(is.finite(Minutes_played), is.finite(three_point_persentage))

# Choose the player to highlight

# Create the scatter plot

  geom_point(color = "blue", alpha = 0.6) +                    # Scatter points
  geom_point(data = wnba_clean[wnba_clean$Player == highlight_player, ], 
             aes(x = Minutes_played, y = three_point_persentage), color = "red", size = 4) +  # Highlight player
